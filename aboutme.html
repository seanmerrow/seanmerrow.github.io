## Employment

![Red Hat](https://seanmerrow.github.io/images/cisco-logo.jpg)  *2006-2016* - During my ten years at Cisco, I supported several products and technologies. The first four years were spent on load balancers followed by a year supporting IP video surveillance. My last two years of support was spent as an escalation support engineer supporting Verizon Wireless's evolved packet core. I then transitioned from a support role to a technical marketing engineer/architect in the area of NFV working on virtualized packet core, GiLAN and OpenStack.
